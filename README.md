Weather and Map App

## Setup

- clone repo
- composer install
- npm install

- php artisan migrate (did not use a database but the command is needed)
- php artisan serve
- npm run dev

## UI

I chose to include a map in the UI because it offers several key benefits, especially given that the main users of the app are tourists. A map provides visual context, helping users better understand geographical layouts and navigate more effectively by seeing routes and landmarks. This feature makes the UI more informative when paired with weather information and details about trending venues near the searched address. The map enhances user engagement, providing an interactive and immersive experience that is particularly valuable for tourists seeking comprehensive and real-time information about their surroundings.
